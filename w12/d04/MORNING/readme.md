# Morning!

Work for 10 minutes with a partner whiteboarding out how you would implement sorting a deck of cards.
What if you can only compare two cards at a time?
How would you sort an array of random numbers?

Then fork and clone https://github.com/phlco/sort_chall

Work individually to write the tests and the passing code for a sorting function in either Ruby or Javascript.

Name your function in the following format: `name_sort()`

Issue a pull request.

We'll review benchmarking our javascript and ruby code to see who has the most efficient sorting method.

Then we'll review project proposals.
