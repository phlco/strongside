# turbolinks
- only the body and title are replaced
- The more CSS and Javascript you have, the bigger the benefit of:
    - not throwing away the browser instance
    - not downloading CSS/JS over and over
    - not recompiling all of it for every page
- problem:
  ```js
  $(document).ready(function() {
      alert("DOM is ready!");
  });
  ```
  - listen for the `page:load` event
      ```js
      //as a matter of fact, listen for both!
      $(document).on('ready page:load', function(){
          alert("DOM is ready!");
      });
      ```

???
It works by fetching the clicked link asynchronously and then replacing the entire contents of the document body with the new page.

- benefit: save time on the client-side by not having to check for existing css, js, and possibly images
---
# tip: jquery-turbolinks

Alternatively, we can include `jquery-turbolinks`, which will will ensure that ready() will only fire after "page:load"
https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks

```
# Gemfile
gem 'jquery-turbolinks'
```

```
# assets/javascripts/application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.turbolinks  #order is important!
//= require_ujs
//= require turbolinks
```

---
# turbolinks events

- `page:fetch` - starting to fetch the target page (only called if loading fresh, not from cache).
- `page:load` - fetched page is being retrieved fresh from the server
- `page:restore` - fetched page is being retrieved from the 10-slot client-side cache
- `page:change` - page has changed to the newly fetched version
---

# selective disabling

```html
<a href="/post" data-no-turbolink="true">Posts</a>
```

???
Client-side frameworks: Turbolinks may not play nicely with other client-side frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Knockout, Ember, etc.

# mass-assignment protection

```rails3
# app/models/kid.rb
class Kid < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Only allow the following attributes to be mass-assigned
  attr_accessible :name, :age, :address, :girl #, :good
end

# app/controllers/kids_controller.rb
class KidsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @kid = Kid.new(params[:kid])
    if @kid.save
      redirect_to root_url
    else
      render action: "new"
    end
  end
end
```

???
In Rails 3, the model is responsible for whitelisting parameters

whitelists attributes, allowing them
to be set via mass assignment

---
# strong_parameters

- `attr_accessible` and `attr_protected` removed from rails core and extracted to the `protected_attributes` gem
- replaced by `strong_parameters`
- Reason:
    - pass responsibility to controllers instead of models

---
# strong_parameters

```rails4
# app/models/kid.rb
class Kid < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# app/controllers/kids_controller.rb
class KidsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @kid.create(params.require(:kid).permit(:name, :age))
  end
  # Kid.create(params[:kid]) =>
  # ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributes
end
```

--
**require(key)** - ensures that a parameter is present. If it's present, returns the parameter at the given key, otherwise raises an ActionController::ParameterMissing error.

**permit(filters)** - Returns the new ActionController::Parameters instance that includes only the given filters and sets the permitted attribute for the object to true. This is useful for limiting which attributes should be allowed for mass updating.
???
the model no longer handles
parameter whitelisting

params.require performs parameter
validation, also checks parameter types

Using permit strips out anything that is not permitted, but won't mind if a permitted attribute is missing

---
# strong_parameters

Use a private method to keep duplication between actions at bay.

```rails4
# app/controllers/kids_controller.rb
class KidsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @kid.create(kid_params)
  end

  def update
    @kid.update(kid_params)
  end

  private
    def kid_params
      params.require(:kid).permit(:name, :age)
    end
end
```

---
# protected_attributes

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name
end
```

```
# Gemfile
gem 'protected_attributes'
```

```
# application.rb
config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true
```

---

# match routes

```rails3
match "/toys/:id/purchase", to: "toys#purchase"
```

- `match` responds to all HTTP verbs (POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET)
- <b> problem: </b>
    - potential cross site request forgery (CSRF)
    - CSRF protection already exists in Rails but not for the `GET` method
---
# solution

```rails4
get "/toys/:id/purchase", to: "toys#purchase"

match "toys/:id/purchase", to: "toys#purchase", via: :get

match "toys/:id/purchase", to: "toys#purchase", via: [:get, :post]
```
Rails 4 forces a verb to be present on `match` routes

---
# before_filter is now before_action

```rails4
before_action :set_user, :except => [:index, :new, :create}
before_action :require_the_president, :only => [:fire_the_missiles]
```

> “To avoid the misconception that these callbacks are only suited for transforming or halting the response. With the new style, it’s more inviting to use them as they were intended, such as setting shared ivars for views.” - _DHH_

???
The old *_filter callbacks still work and are not deprecated; so, you can still use them if you wish
---

# routing concerns

```rails3
# config/routes.rb
resources :messages do
  resources :comments
  resources :categories
  resources :tags
end

resources :posts do
  resources :comments
  resources :categories
  resources :tags
end

resources :items do
  resources :comments
  resources :categories
  resources :tags
end
```

???
helps reduce code duplication on your routes file by allowing you to declare common routes that can be reused inside other resources and routes.
---

# routing concerns

```rails4
concern :sociable do
  resources :comments
  resources :categories
  resources :tags
end

resources :messages, concerns: sociable
resources :posts, concerns: sociable
resources :items, concerns: sociable
```

???
Routing Concerns is an attempt to DRY up your config/routes.rb. The basic idea is to define common sub-resources (like comments) as concerns and include them in other resources/routes.
---
# routing concerns

```rails4
# config/routes.rb
concern :sociable do
  resources :comments
  resources :categories
  resources :tags
end

resources [:messages, :posts, :items], concerns: sociable
```
---
# model concerns

.hlf[
```
# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
  def trash
    update_attribute :trashed, true
  end
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def trash
    update_attribute :trashed, true
  end
end
```
]
--
.hlf[
```
# app/models/concerns/trashable.rb
module Trashable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  def trash
    update_attribute :trashed, true
  end
end
```
]

---
# model concerns

.hlf[
```
# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Trashable
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Trashable
end
```
]

.hlf[
```
# app/models/concerns/trashable.rb
module Trashable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  def trash
    update_attribute :trashed, true
  end
end
```
]

???

The extend ActiveSupport::Concern tells rails that we are creating a concern.

# PATCH verb
---
# PUT

- resource creation or replacement at a given URL
- must send a complete representation of the resource

---
# PATCH

- PATCH is the primary method for updates in Rails 4.0
- allows full and partial updates
- both PUT and PATCH are routed to `update`

```
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  # PATCH/PUT /posts/1
  # PATCH/PUT /posts/1.json
  def update
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

???
Previous versions of Rails used PUT in place of PATCH, and Rails 4.0 still supports this usage, but PATCH matches the intended HTTP usage better and is preferred for new applications. So GET, POST, PUT, DELETE is now GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.

# live streaming

- Use Puma or Rainbows!

```
# Gemfile
gem 'puma'
```

```
class MyController < ActionController::Base
  include ActionController::Live

  def stream
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'
    10.times {
      response.stream.write "hello world\n"
        sleep 1
    }
    response.stream.close
  end
end
```
