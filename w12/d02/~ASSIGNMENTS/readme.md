1. Finish an MVP of your projects
2. [Submit an initial project proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BhDvoBUGFbrqAqHZA7PAtlWKNfI0l6zjlZkglbMT5tE/viewform) just so we get an idea what people are working on.

Completely Optional:
Try implementing the Fibonacci Numbers recursively:
- fib(0) returns the 0th Fibonacci number
- fib(1) returns the 1st Fibonacci number
- fib(99) returns the 99th Fibonacci number

Completely Completely Optional Extra Extra Credit:
- fib(99) takes a really long time to calculate, can you find a way to use a global hash so that it is not so slow?

Cheers!
