# FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Feature: Final Project

- In order to demonstrate what you've learned

- We want to see some final projects!

Scenario:

- And we expect it to have greater than 50% test coverage
- And we expect the tests to be passing
- And we expect it to be well documented

## OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to showcase everything you have learned over the past 3 months and to show the world what you can do!

We suggest that you work on this project individually to create a strong example of your skills in your portfolio.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

1. Rails back-end with a database
2. Developed with BDD => TDD using Rspec and Jasmine
3. The application is deployed to Heroku
4. The application is well-documented in your github repo
5. Your application contains a readme with a Travis:CI Badge demonstrating a Passing Build.

**Note:** You may use any sweet libs or gems that you like, but remember to focus on code quality, good tests and documentation. Those will be the things that potential employers will care about the most.


## TIMELINE
* The project will start on Wednesday, December 11th
* We'll be doing a scrum every day in groups of 3/4

## DELIVERABLES

* **Proposal** (Due Thursday, December 12th)
  1. A detailed 1 paragraph description of your project project
  2. High Level User Stories & Wireframes
  3. Phases & Iteration Cycles
  	- Include a detailed description for what specific features belong in which phases and indicate a date that you expect this to be done by. Be conservative in your date estimations and optimize for smaller phases (so it is more likely than not to have something complete (at the end of a phase) than it is to have things broken (if you're in the middle of a phase))
  4. Detailed User Stories for Phase 1
  5. Data Model
 


* **Final Deliverables** (Due Thursday, December 19th)
  * Link to Github Repo
  * Link to Heroku App

**Note:** Don't let the December 19th date limit you in your vision. After the course ends, you can continue working on and improving your app. Remember, the GA hiring events are not until January.

## Good luck! We are really proud of you!
