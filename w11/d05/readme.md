# Week 11 Day 5

## Homework - Portfolio sites

You should be working on your portfolio sites over the weekend.

Your homework assignment is simply to submit the public facing URL where your portfolio site *will* be. Add the URL to the README.md that's inside of your personal folder and submit a pull-request before Monday.

We know that your site may not be completed by Monday, and that's okay. We aren't going to look at them yet -- we just want to make sure that you have a web address up.

## Github Pages

[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) is free hosting for static sites and is suited perfectly for a personal portfolio.

Use this walk-through guide to [setup your site](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/). Just know that when the guide asks whether you're setting up User Pages or Project Pages, you want to choose User Pages.

That's it!

And if you would like to continue working on the "wink" application from today's class, certainly do that as well!
