## One on Ones
Each week you'll meet individually with a member of the instructional team.  Please come with questions about any of your code. We'll post the schedule every Monday for the week.  The format for one-on-ones is a general check-up, including

- How are you doing?
- What's working in the class for you?
- Code review
- What commitments can we hold you to until our next meeting?
