# Homework!

We've constructed Backbone models and collections. Now it's time to connect these with Views.

Create a Backbone view that displays all the films.

Create buttons in the View for each one of the collection's methods.

When you click on a button update the View to display that information.

## Extras

Change the buttons to a select box.

Display the films in a table and make the table sortable.

Can you rewrite the bond methods with Ruby?

Can you write RSPEC tests for the Ruby version?

Write Capybara tests for the View.
