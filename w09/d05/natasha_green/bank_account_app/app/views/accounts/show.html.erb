<!--Note:  form_for makes it easy to have a set of fields and populate them from a model object, then gather up the results and put them into a hash which can be assigned directly back to the same type of model object to create a new one or edit the values in it. But we donâ€™t have a model for this page, we just one one value (a number in this case) returned to the controller so form_tag is what makes sense. -->

<!--
#create a form to deposit and withdraw
# form helper --  the method in the form will be for the post
# ajax request to increase or decrease money
# you can do a regular form submission
#through the update method you can do a change to the database
# do a redirect to the same page as a starter
#the redirect will be a refresh to show the balance is actually changing
