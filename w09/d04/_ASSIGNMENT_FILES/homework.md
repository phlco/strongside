Homework

# The Preparation

Read about testing in the Every Day Rails blog, chapters 1-4

- [How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 1: Introduction ](http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/12/testing-series-intro.html)

- [How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 2: Setting up RSpec](http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/12/testing-series-rspec-setup.html)

- [How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 3: Model specs](http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/19/testing-series-rspec-models-factory-girl.html)

- [How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 4: Controller specs] (http://everydayrails.com/2012/04/07/testing-series-rspec-controllers.html)






# The Mission
Your mission is to finish writing the model tests and models for (Owner and Machine), and controller tests, and controllers just (Owner)for the CandyMachine rails application.

[Here are the specifications for the candy machine app we derived togther in class
](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Hash_Work/blob/master/w09/d04/_ASSIGNMENT_FILES/candy.md)

Extra Credit:

- Figure out how to do do the controller tests if Machine was nested under the Owner resources
- Add additional controller actions for refill, and buy.


## References

### The Pokemon Application that we put together in class together 

(the same one that you worked on for homework that is refactored)

Take a look a at the model code and the model tests closely.
